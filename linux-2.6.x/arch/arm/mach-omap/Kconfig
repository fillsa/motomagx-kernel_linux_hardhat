config OMAP_BOOT_TAG
	bool "OMAP bootloader information passing"
        depends on ARCH_OMAP
        default n
        help
          Say Y, if you have a bootloader which passes information
          about your board and its peripheral configuration.

config OMAP_BOOT_REASON
	bool "Support for boot reason"
        depends on OMAP_BOOT_TAG
        default n
        help
          Say Y, if you want to have a procfs entry for reading the boot
          reason in user-space.

config OMAP_GPIO_SWITCH
	bool "GPIO switch support"
        depends on OMAP_BOOT_TAG
        default n
        help
          Say Y, if you want to have support for input layer reporting
          of GPIO switches (e.g. cover switches). Your bootloader has to
          provide information about the switches to the kernel via the
          ATAG_OMAP mechanism.

config OMAP_MUX
	bool "OMAP multiplexing support"
        depends on ARCH_OMAP
	default y
        help
          Pin multiplexing support for OMAP boards. If your bootloader
          sets the multiplexing correctly, say N. Otherwise, or if unsure,
          say Y.

config OMAP_MUX_DEBUG
	bool "Multiplexing debug output"
        depends on OMAP_MUX
        default n
        help
          Makes the multiplexing functions print out a lot of debug info.
          This is useful if you want to find out the correct values of the
          multiplexing registers.

config OMAP_MUX_WARNINGS
	bool "Warn about pins the bootloader didn't set up"
        depends on OMAP_MUX
        default y
        help
	  Choose Y here to warn whenever driver initialization logic needs
	  to change the pin multiplexing setup.  When there are no warnings
	  printed, it's safe to deselect OMAP_MUX for your product.

choice
        prompt "System timer"
	default OMAP_MPU_TIMER

config OMAP_MPU_TIMER
	bool "Use mpu timer"
	help
	  Select this option if you want to use the OMAP mpu timer. This
	  timer provides more intra-tick resolution than the 32KHz timer,
	  but consumes more power.

config OMAP_32K_TIMER
	bool "Use 32KHz timer"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP16XX
	help
	  Select this option if you want to enable the OMAP 32KHz timer.
	  This timer saves power compared to the OMAP_MPU_TIMER, and has
	  support for no tick during idle. The 32KHz timer provides less
	  intra-tick resolution than OMAP_MPU_TIMER. The 32KHz timer is
	  currently only available for OMAP-16xx.

config NO_IDLE_HZ
	bool "Variable Scheduling Timer (VST)"
	depends on OMAP_32K_TIMER
	help
	  Select this option if you want to disable continuous timer ticks
	  and have them programmed one at a time from the idle loop. This
	  option saves power as the system does not need to exit idle state
	  because of a timer interrupt. If you have this option selected,
	  you still need to enable VST using the sysfs interface. By default
	  VST is disabled during the boot, and can be manually enabled with:

 	  echo 1 > /sys/devices/platform/timer0/vst

	  If you want VST automatically enabled during boot, select also
	  NO_IDLE_HZ_ENABLED below.

config NO_IDLE_HZ_ENABLED
	bool "Enable Variable Scheduling Timer (VST) by default"
	depends on NO_IDLE_HZ
	default n
	help
	  Select this option if you want VST turned on by default during boot.

config OMAP_SERIAL_WAKE

	default y
	help
	  Select this option if you want to have your system wake up
	  to data on the serial RX line. This allows you to wake the
	  system from serial console. Currently only uart1 RX line can
	  be used as wake up source.
