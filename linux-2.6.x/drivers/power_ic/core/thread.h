 * out relative priorities between threads easier, as well as explaining any rationale
 * behind their settings.

 * From high to low priority, the current thread priority order is:
 *
 * - Event thread
 * - Debounce thread
 * - EMU state machine thread

 * @brief Priority for event handling thread.
 *
 * The thread that deals with events for the driver needs to have a high priority in order
 * to keep event latency to a minimum. At this time, this is the highest-priority thread
 * in the driver  */
#define THREAD_PRIORITY_EVENT      (MAX_RT_PRIO - 1)

/*! 
 * @brief Priority for debouncing thread.
 *
 * The debounce thread will usually run soon after an event occurs in order to debounce
 * a signal. Since debouncing takes a significant amount of time, this isn't quite as 
 * critical, so this has a lower priority than the event thread. */
#define THREAD_PRIORITY_DEBOUNCE    (MAX_RT_PRIO - 3)

/*! 
 * @brief Priority for EMU state machine thread.
 *
 * The EMU state machine will run on EMU bus-related events and will involve a lot of
 * switching controls on and off and debouncing. All this will likely take a while,
 * so this is the lowest priority thread for the driver, although this thread should
 * still have a higher than normal priority so that it isn't blocked by the screensaver
 * or whatever. */
