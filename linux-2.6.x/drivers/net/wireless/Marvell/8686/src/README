	Usage:	
		wlanconfig -v
 
rdmac 
rdbbp
rdrf	
	These commands are used to read the MAC, BBP and RF registers from the 
	card.  These commands take one parameter that specifies the offset 
	location that is to be read.  This parameter can be specified either in 
	decimal or in hexadecimal (by preceding the number with a "0x").
		
	Usage:

wrmac 
wrbbp
wrrf	
	These commands are used to write the MAC, BBP and RF registers in the 
	card.  These commands take two parameters that specify the offset 
	location and the value that is to be written. This parameters can be 
	specified either in decimal or in hexadecimal (by preceding the number 
	with a "0x").

caldataext
	In order to overcome the situation without EEPROM in the WLAN module, 
	we send the extension calibration command to modify the existing 
	hardware-spec command. This command takes one parameter that specifies 
	the file name of the configuration file.

	Usage:
	wlanconfig eth1 caldataext <cal_data_ext_set_<version>.conf>
		cal_data_ext_set_<version>.conf is a configuration file to the 
		wlanconfig to set the calibration values. The 3 existing 
		versions are v5, vA and v7. 
		Example:

	Usage:
	wlanconfig ethX rdeeprom 0x00 0x10
	
sleepparams       
	This command is used to set the sleepclock configurations
	
	Usage:
		wlanconfig ethX sleepparams get: reads the current sleepclock configuration
	
		wlanconfig ethX sleepparams set p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6: writes the sleepclock configuration.
			
		where:
			p1 is Sleep clock error in ppm (0-65535)
			p2 is Wakeup offset in usec (0-65535)
			p3 is Clock stabilization time in usec (0-65535)
			p4 is Control periodic calibration (0-2)
			p5 is Control the use of external sleep clock (0-2)
			p6 is reserved for debug (0-65535)

bca-ts
	This command is used to set/get the BCA timeshare parameters.
 
	This command only works after BCA been enabled. 
	
	Usage:
		wlanconfig ethX bca-ts <Traffic Type> <TimeShareInterval> <BTTime>

		where:
			Traffic Type 0 - Wlan and bluetooth are low priority.
				     1 - Wlan and bluetooth are high priority.
 	
			TimeShareInterval value is not multiple of 10 then floor value 
			is taken and the valid range is < 20 ... 60,000 > in milliseconds.

			BTTime value is  not multiple of 10 then floor value is
			taken and the valid range is < 0 ... TimeShareInterval value >
			in milliseconds.

	Example:
		wlanconfig ethX bca-ts get 1  
				get the BCA timeshare settings when wlan and bluetooth are set to high priority.  

		wlanconfig ethX bca-ts set 1 30 20
				set wlan and bluetooth to high priority, wlan TimeShareInterval to 30ms, BTTime to 20ms.

	A single configuration is used for both the commands.
	The configuration may contain all the command. The configuration of
	each command should be in [command] Configuration [/command].

wmm_ack_policy
	This command will set the acknowledgement policy for a particular AC.

	Usage:
		"wlanconfig eth1 wmm_ack_policy" - This will get the Ack Policy
		for all the AC and will display it to the user.

      keep=[0 or 1]            keep the previous scan results (1), discard (0)
      dur=[scan time]          time to scan for each channel in milliseconds
      probes=[#]               number of probe requests to send on each chan
      type=[1,2,3]             BSS type: 1 (Infra), 2(Adhoc), 3(Any)
 
    Any combination of the above arguments can be supplied on the command line.
      If the chan token is absent, a full channel scan will be completed by 
      the driver.  If the dur or probes tokens are absent, the driver default
      setting will be used.  The bssid and ssid fields, if blank, 
      will produce an unfiltered scan. The type field will default to 3 (Any)
      and the keep field will default to 0 (Discard).

    Examples:
    1) Perform an active scan on channels 1, 6, and 11 in the 'g' band:
            setuserscan chan=1g,6g,11g

    2) Perform a passive scan on channel 11 for 20 ms:
            setuserscan chan=11gp dur=20

    3) Perform an active scan on channels 1, 6, and 11; and a passive scan on
       channel 36 in the 'a' band:
            setuserscan chan=1g,6g,11g,36ap

    4) Perform an active scan on channel 6 and 36 for a specific SSID:
            setuserscan chan=6g,36a ssid="TestAP"

    5) Scan all available channels (B/G, A bands) for a specific BSSID, keep
       the current scan table intact, update existing or append new scan data:
            setuserscan bssid=00:50:43:20:12:82 keep=1

    6) Scan channel 6, for all infrastructure networks, sending two probe 
       requests.  Keep the previous scan table intact. Update any duplicate
       BSSID/SSID matches with the new scan data:
            setuserscan chan=6g type=1 probes=2 keep=1

    All entries in the scan table (not just the new scan data when keep=1) 
    will be displayed upon completion by use of the getscantable ioctl.

getscantable
    Display the current contents of the driver scan table

    Usage:
       wlanconfig ethX getscantable

getassocrsp
    Display the contents of the driver association response buffer

    Usage:
       wlanconfig ethX getassocrsp

setmrvltlv
    Setup a test Marvell TLV for the driver to insert in the next 
       association command to the firmware.  

    wlanconfig will provision a test TLV that can be verified in the assoc.
       response to the AP.  Used to test the IOCTL functionality.

    Usage:
       wlanconfig ethX setmrvltlv

addts
    Send an ADDTS command to the associated AP.

    Process a given conf file for a specific TSPEC data block.  Send the
      TSPEC along with any other IEs to the driver/firmware for transmission
      in an ADDTS request to the associated AP.  
 
    Return the execution status of the command as well as the ADDTS response
      from the AP if any.
   
    Usage:
       wlanconfig ethX addts <filename.conf> <section# of tspec> <timeout(ms)>

delts
    Send a DELTS command to the associated AP.

    Process a given conf file for a specific TSPEC data block.  Send the
      TSPEC along with any other IEs to the driver/firmware for transmission
      in a DELTS request to the associated AP.  
 
    Return the execution status of the command.  There is no response to a
      DELTS from the AP.
   
    Usage:
       wlanconfig ethX delts <filename.conf> <section# of tspec>

qconfig
    Send a WMM AC Queue configuration command to get/set/default params
 
    Configure or get the parameters of a WMM AC queue. The command takes
      an optional Queue Id as a last parameter.  Without the queue id, all
      queues will be acted upon.
 
    Usage:  
       wlanconfig ethX qconfig set msdu <lifetime in TUs> [Queue Id: 0-3]
       wlanconfig ethX qconfig get [Queue Id: 0-3]
       wlanconfig ethX qconfig def [Queue Id: 0-3]

qstats
    Turn on/off or retrieve and clear the queue statistics for an AC

    Turn the queue statistics collection on/off for a given AC or retrieve the
      current accumulated stats and clear them from the firmware.  The command
      takes an optional Queue Id as a last parameter.  Without the queue id,
      all queues will be acted upon.
 
    Usage:
       wlanconfig ethX qstats on  [Queue Id: 0-3]
       wlanconfig ethX qstats off [Queue Id: 0-3]
       wlanconfig ethX qstats get [Queue Id: 0-3]
