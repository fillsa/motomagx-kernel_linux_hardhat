config MTD_NAND_VERIFY_WRITE
	bool "Verify NAND page writes"
	depends on MTD_NAND
	help
	  This adds an extra check when data is written to the flash. The
	  NAND flash device internally checks only bits transitioning
	  from 1 to 0. There is a rare possibility that even though the
	  device thinks the write was successful, a bit could have been
	  flipped accidentaly due to device wear or something else.

	  Enable the use of the S3C2410's internal ECC generator when
	  using NAND. Early versions of the chip have had problems with
	  incorrect ECC generation, and if using these, the default of
	  software ECC is preferable.

	  If you lay down a device with the hardware ECC, then you will
	  currently not be able to switch to software, as there is no
	  implementation for ECC method used by the S3C2410

	  these devices.

config MTD_NAND_DISKONCHIP_PROBE_ADVANCED
        bool "Advanced detection options for DiskOnChip"
        depends on MTD_NAND_DISKONCHIP
        help
          This option allows you to specify nonstandard address at which to
          probe for a DiskOnChip, or to change the detection options.  You
          are unlikely to need any of this unless you are using LinuxBIOS.
          Say 'N'.

config MTD_NAND_DISKONCHIP_PROBE_ADDRESS

        depends on MTD_NAND_DISKONCHIP
        default "0"
        ---help---
        By default, the probe for DiskOnChip devices will look for a
        DiskOnChip at every multiple of 0x2000 between 0xC8000 and 0xEE000.
        This option allows you to specify a single address at which to probe
        for the device, which is useful if you have other devices in that
        range which get upset when they are probed.

        (Note that on PowerPC, the normal probe will only check at
        0xE4000000.)

        Normally, you should leave this set to zero, to allow the probe at
        the normal addresses.

config MTD_NAND_DISKONCHIP_PROBE_HIGH
        bool "Probe high addresses"
        depends on MTD_NAND_DISKONCHIP_PROBE_ADVANCED
        help
          By default, the probe for DiskOnChip devices will look for a
          DiskOnChip at every multiple of 0x2000 between 0xC8000 and 0xEE000.
          This option changes to make it probe between 0xFFFC8000 and
          0xFFFEE000.  Unless you are using LinuxBIOS, this is unlikely to be
          useful to you.  Say 'N'.

config MTD_NAND_DISKONCHIP_BBTWRITE
	bool "Allow BBT writes on DiskOnChip Millennium and 2000TSOP"
	depends on MTD_NAND_DISKONCHIP
	help
	  On DiskOnChip devices shipped with the INFTL filesystem (Millennium
	  and 2000 TSOP/Alon), Linux reserves some space at the end of the
	  device for the Bad Block Table (BBT).  If you have existing INFTL
	  data on your device (created by non-Linux tools such as M-Systems'
	  DOS drivers), your data might overlap the area Linux wants to use for
	  the BBT.  If this is a concern for you, leave this option disabled and
	  Linux will not write BBT data into this area.
	  The downside of leaving this option disabled is that if bad blocks
	  are detected by Linux, they will not be recorded in the BBT, which
	  could cause future problems.
	  Once you enable this option, new filesystems (INFTL or others, created
	  in Linux or other operating systems) will not use the reserved area.
	  The only reason not to enable this option is to prevent damage to
	  preexisting filesystems.
	  Even if you leave this disabled, you can enable BBT writes at module
	  load time (assuming you build diskonchip as a module) with the module
	  parameter "inftl_bbt_write=1".
