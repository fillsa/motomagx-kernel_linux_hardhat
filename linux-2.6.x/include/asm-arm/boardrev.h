/* ***************************************************************************
 *
 * NOTICE: Be careful when using boardrev() to test for a range of values.
 *
 * For instance, this test for P5A closed-phones will also evaluate to
 * true for P5A wingboards:
 * 
 *   if( ( boardrev() >= BOARD_REV_P5A ) && ( boardrev() < BOARD_REV_P6A ) ) {
 *       ...
 *   }
 *
 * It is generally safe to numerically compare board revisions within a
 * particular series of the same style of board. For insance boardrev()
 * for a P5B wingboard (BOARD_REV_P5BW) will always return a value less
 * than what it would return for a P5D wingboard (BOARD_REV_P5DW).
 *
 * However, the current convention is that boardrev() will always return
 * a higher value for any wingboard with the same P# name as a closed phone.
 * For instance boardrev() will return a numerically higher value for a P6A
 * wingboard (BOARD_REV_P6AW) than it will return for a P6H closed-phone
 * (BOARD_REV_P6H).
