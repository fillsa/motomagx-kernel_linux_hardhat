/*
 * This module contains the code to process the arch_cycle timers.  When
 * the timer list (in kernel/timer.c) finds a timer that expires with a
 * non-zero arch_cycle_expire value it passes it to
 * do_arch_cycle_timer() which does one of two things:
 *
 * 1) if the timer has expired, passes it on to the call back function, or 
 * 2) puts it in an ordered list of such timers which will expire in the
 *    current jiffie.  

 * There are various ways to call this code depending on if the timer
 * can be delivered immeadiately.  Some timers, such as those from
 * add_timer, can not be delivered immeadiately as such delivery might
 * cause recursion possibly to the end of the kernels days
 * uh.. nanoseconds.
 *
 * Timers that are pending delivery are put into a pending list.  This
 * is used both for the above case and for cases where we detect that
 * the jiffie has expired and need to clear the list to make way for
 * arch_cycle timers in the now current jiffie.  Since these can come in
 * as a result of expiring a timer, we need to clean the list up first.
 * We just move all the timers to the expired list.
 *
 * Speaking of lists, we handle either one list set (pending and
 * expired) per cpu or one global list for all cpus.  The choice is to
 * be made by the arch code and should depend on if a per cpu timer is
 * being used to do the arch_cycle timing.  The i386 arch uses per cpu
 * hardware, other archs may not have such.
