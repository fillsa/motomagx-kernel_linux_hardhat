MAINTAINER NOTES FOR CKBUILD
----------------------------

These files were edited by hand, but the diffs are not that big:

scripts/Makefile.build
scripts/Makefile.lib
scripts/Makefile.modpost
scripts/Makefile.modinst

This file was written by copying bits over from Kbuild:

Makefile

This file was automatically generated from the Kbuild one using
scripts/mk2cmk.pl:

arch/arm/Makefile

These files have no equivalent in Kbuild:

ckbuild.mk : makefile fragment included by modules using ckbuild
ckbuildvars.mk : definition of variables used by ckbuild.mk 
scripts/if.sh : used to replace Kbuild's $(if ...
scripts/cc-option.sh : used to replace Kbuild's $(call cc-option...
scripts/cc-option-yn.sh : used to replace Kbuild's $(call cc-option-yn..
